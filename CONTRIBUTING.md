## Guidelines for creating GitHub tickets to contribut annotations:

1. **Write a detailed request:** Please be specific and include as many details as necessary, providing background information, and if possible, suggesting a solution. GOC editors will be better equipped to address your suggestions if you offer details regarding *'what is new'*, *'what is wrong'*, *'why'*, and *'how to fix it'*.

2. **Provide examples and references:** Please include PMIDs in support of the annotations you wish to contribute or update; you may also include  screenshots, or URLs that lend support to your annotations.

3. **Add a label:** please mark each issue with one of the labels available from the menu to facilitate tracking and processing.

4. Tickets with insufficient detail will be marked with a *'More info needed'* label to alert the submitter.

5. Issues with UniProt, for example wrong keywords on UniProt entries, issues with HAMAP, or UniPathway should be submitted directly to the UniProt team via http://www.uniprot.org/update, or by email to help@uniprot.org

6. Issues pertaining to the GOA should be addressed directly with EBI GOA curators at goa@ebi.ac.uk
