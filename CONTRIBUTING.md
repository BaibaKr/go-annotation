Please follow these guidelines when creating GitHub annotation tickets:

Be specific. Add as many details to your issue, provide background information and if possible suggest a solution. Keep in mind that the person trying to address your ticket may not have the same background as you, so please be explicit. What is wrong, why, how you'd suggest to fix it, etc.

Please add the relevant label to your issue. Note that this tracker is *not* monitored by UniProt curators, so issues pertaining to things such as wrong keywords on UniProt entries, issues with HAMAP, UniPathway should be submitted via http://www.uniprot.org/update, or sent by email to help@uniprot.org
